# Business Lawyer Directory Docs

## Contents
- `functional_requirements.md`: User stories (with IDs by epic), acceptance criteria (checklist and analytics coverage), business logic, non-visible/back-end requirements, and Definition of Done for the Avvo-style directory and profile experience.
- `project_plan.md`: Overview, phased delivery (worst-case durations), team composition (full and minimal), implementation/delivery timeline, UAT stage, observability/analytics deliverables, risks, and release approach.

## How to use
- Start with `functional_requirements.md` to understand scope, behaviors, and success criteria per user story.
- Use `project_plan.md` to see sequencing, timelines, roles, and what gets demoed/released each phase.
- US IDs in the requirements map to testing and analytics in the plan; treat acceptance criteria as a checklist for dev, QA, and UAT.
